## Contributing Code and Issues
Metaflow is under very active development and is also being used widely at Netflix. We’re 
working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, 
but we’re not quite there yet.

We'd appreciate [issue reports](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues) if you run into trouble 
using Metaflow.
